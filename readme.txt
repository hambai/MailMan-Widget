* Based on [MailChimp Widget](https://github.com/kalchas/MailChimp-Widget)
* Powered by [PHP MailMan](https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-mailman/)

== Known issues ==

* Security: Admin passwords must be stored in plain text in order to perform the subscribe action. Ideally MailMan would have an API which would not require use of the admin password to perform trivial actions.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0 =
* Beta, based on the MailChimp Widget and the PHP-MailMan Class.

= 1.x =
* Alpha, based on the poorly executed, python powered wp-mailman plugin.
